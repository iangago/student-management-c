# Student Management System (C)

## Description
A simple terminal-based student management system written in C.
The program allows the user to add, view, and update a single student's data.

This project was built to practice:
- control flow
- functions
- input validation
- basic program structure in C

## Features
- Add student (name and age)
- Display student data
- Update name, age, or both
- Input validation for menu options and age

## How to Run
1. Compile the program:
gcc src/main.c -o student

2. Run the executable:
./student

## What I Learned
- How to structure a menu-driven program
- How to validate user input safely using strings
- Why code duplication is a problem
- How functions improve readability and maintenance

## Future Improvements
- Support multiple students
- Improve input validation
- Store data in files
